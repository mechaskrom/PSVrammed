1. Introduction ---------------------------------------------------------------

PSVrammed is a PlayStation 1 emulator state VRAM viewer and simple editor. With
it you can open state files and view the VRAM content and then save it as
images or edit it and save the changes back to the state file. Its primary use
is to rip graphics from games or to temporarily change graphics when taking
emulator screenshots. I created it when I was working on making maps for a game
because I needed a simple way to screenshot different layers.

How well the editor works for changing graphics depends on how often the game
reloads VRAM. Usually that only happens when you move between different places
in a game.

Supported emulator state files at the moment are:
-ePSXe
-pSX (PSXFin)
-BizHawk Octoshock PSX core
-DuckStation

Raw 1MB VRAM dumps are also supported.

PSVrammed cannot convert files so saved file will be in the same format as the
source.


2. Installation ---------------------------------------------------------------

No installation is needed. Just run the exe file to start PSVrammed.
Microsoft's .NET 6.0 desktop runtime is required though, but if it's missing
you should get a prompt directing you to the installer.


3. PlayStation VRAM overview --------------------------------------------------

To use PSVrammed it is good to have at least some basic understanding of how
PlayStation graphics and video ram (VRAM) work. Documentation and info can be
found on the internet so I suggest a look if all of this is unknown to you.

A typical VRAM layout is shown below. Games don't have to use this layout, but
it is very common. The important thing here is the three major parts in VRAM.

    +--------------------+----------------------------------------------+

    +--------------------+                                              |
    |      Palettes      |                                              |
    +--------------------+----------------------------------------------+

Framebuffers (16 bit or 24 bit):
2 buffers (double buffering). One is outputted to the display while the other
is used for drawing the next frame to be displayed.

Textures (4 bit, 8 bit, 16 bit or 24 bit):
Actual graphic to use for drawing stuff.

Palettes (16 bit):
Also known as color lookup tables (CLUT). Contains the colors to use for 4 bit
and 8 bit textures.

VRAM content is stored in one of four different formats or bit depths:
-4 bits form an index (0 to 15) into a palette.
-8 bits form an index (0 to 255) into a palette.
-16 bits form an RGB color. Red, green and blue have five bits each for
intensity (0 to 31). The extra alpha bit is used for color blending or masking.
-24 bits form an RGB color. Red, green and blue have eight bits each for
intensity (0 to 255).

The different VRAM parts and bit depths are reflected in the different modes
PSVrammed can be used in.


4. Modes ----------------------------------------------------------------------

PSVrammed can display four different windows and which are displayed depends
on the mode used. Each window also has a marker to select current area to work
with. The four windows are (arranged in order displayed, top to bottom):
-Texture displays VRAM in currently selected bit depth. Here you can edit VRAM
or save it as images.
-Compare displays VRAM in 16 bit. Here you can compare 4 bit and 8 bit textures
with the framebuffers to check that the same palette is used.
-Palette displays VRAM in 16 bit. Here you can select the palette to use for
4 bit and 8 bit textures.
-Palette editor displays a table with the currently selected palette's entries.
Here you can edit the palette.

The different modes in PSVrammed and what windows they display:
                                Texture   Compare   Palette   Palette editor
-4 bit indexed view              4 bit       -        yes        -
-4 bit indexed compare           4 bit      yes       yes        -
-4 bit indexed palette editor    4 bit       -        yes       yes
-8 bit indexed view              8 bit       -        yes        -
-8 bit indexed compare           8 bit      yes       yes        -
-8 bit indexed palette editor    8 bit       -        yes       yes
-16 bit rgb view                16 bit       -         -         -
-24 bit rgb view                24 bit       -         -         -


5. Compare --------------------------------------------------------------------

Indexed textures can be compared against the framebuffers to check that the
correct palette is selected before ripping/saving the texture. This will not
work if the game is using overlays or other transparent effects that will
change the texture in the framebuffer.

How to use. Select the texture you want to check with the texture marker and
then select the palette candidate with the palette marker. Now move the compare
marker so it aligns with the texture drawn to the framebuffer. Flip the texture
if the orientation doesn't match. Matching pixels will get a different hue. Try
another palette if not the whole part you want to match is colored differently.

Hue for matching pixels and level of transparency can be changed in the config
markers dialog.


6. Palette editor -------------------------------------------------------------

Double-click or press enter to edit wanted palette entry. The dialog for
entering the new value is similar to 16 bit edit value so see section "7. Edit
values dialog" for information about how it works. The set all entries button
will change the whole palette to the entered value.

Recently entered colors and masks are stored and can be selected in the dialog.

The previous entry edit can also be repeated at the palette marker's current
location. This makes it easy to perform the same edit to multiple palettes.


7. Edit values dialog ---------------------------------------------------------

Four values can be changed in this dialog. The value to use in 4 bit, 8 bit,
16 bit and 24 bit texture edit. To the left is the value in hexadecimal and to
the right is the value in index or color.

4 bit and 8 bit also shows resulting color from currently used palette.
16 bit and 24 bit color can be selected from a color dialog by clicking a
button if you don't want to set the value manually.

16 bit and 24 bit can also specify a mask to use. A checked box means that this
part of the value will not be used/changed. For example if you check the box
for alpha and green then these parts will not change in VRAM when editing. Only
the bits for red and blue will change.


8. Invert operation and layers ------------------------------------------------

The invert operation is perhaps a bit strange, but it's useful when working
with layers in games. It will collect all edits performed until previous invert
(if any exist), set VRAM (marked or all) to current value and then undo
collected edits. If there is nothing to invert the invert operation will be
disabled or do nothing.

Example of use is when ripping two layers in a game. Open the state file, clear
one layer in VRAM (textures and/or palettes), save the changes and screenshot
the remaining layer in the emulator. Now go back to PSVrammed and use invert to
make VRAM only contain the layer you removed before, save the changes and
screenshot the other layer. Use invert and edit sequences to save time and
work.

Remember to clear the alpha flag for all entries in the palette when mapping
transparent 4 bit or 8 bit layers or else the layer will have incorrect colors.
The same applies to 16 bit layers, but there you have to clear the flag in the
textures used.


9. Tools ----------------------------------------------------------------------

PSVrammed is designed to be used with a keyboard primarly, but some mouse-
functions are supported and tools decide how the mouse will work. The different
tools and their functions are:
-None, no function.
-Zoom image, left click to zoom in, right click to zoom out.
-Situate marker, move marker, left click saves location, right click to cancel.
-Inspect pixel, left click saves pixel info, right click to cancel.
-Edit, left click to edit, right click to cancel.

Inspect displays info about the pixel under the mouse cursor. Location, index,
alpha, red, green and blue. Indexed windows (4 bit or 8 bit) displays index
and resulting color from currently used palette. RGB windows displays color.
The info is also displayed in the status bar and a left click will keep it
there.


10. Title bar and status bar --------------------------------------------------

The title bar displays current mode and open state file name. An asterisk after
the file name indicates that changes aren't saved.

The status bar is divided into four sections. From left to right:
-Texture displays texture marker's location (XY) and size (WH).
-Compare displays compare marker's location (XY), orientation of texture
(F, flipped vertically/horizontally) and result alpha (A).
-Palette displays palette marker's location (XY).
-Inspect displays info about inspected pixel.

Texture, compare and palette sections also displays zoom level for respective
window and if alpha status layer is currently showed (@ appended).

Example:
Texture@ (x3): XY=0256,128 WH=064,128
Alpha showed, x3 zoom, marker is located at x=256, y=128 and is 64x128 pixels.

  update. Continuous update uses a lot of CPU-time so it isn't recommended.

[*1]
An edit sequence is a list of edit commands to perform. No VRAM content is
saved in an edit sequence, only operations. Useful if you want to perform the
same edits to many state files or to repeat a common pattern. Saved edit
sequences can be bound to keys (edit slots) for quick access.

[*2]
Alpha bit status is displayed as an overlay. Blue hue means alpha bit is 0 and
yellow hue means it is 1.
